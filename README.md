## Notes
This capability uses an unofficial API (see [debug/ampipy](https://github.com/debug/ambipy)) which may stop working at any point.  At the moment, this capability only exposes the current Temperature and Relative Humidity.  It does not allow any update of Ambi Climate or air conditioner settings.
